Symfony 6.2

I created small database, so for test you will need to make one also. I added fixtures to make the test easier and the migration of the tables. 
I used bootstrap for the css, because there was no wishes  about style. 


1. For migration: php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
2. For fake data: php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
